    <p id="main_article">Welcome! This site is designed in its entirety to just re-enforce what I have learned in HTML and CSS. Eventually with the possibility of adding JavaScript to the site as well. I have not taken any formal training and have learned this entirely from reading books, and articles online.
</p>
      <p id="main_article">I will accredit some of the books I have used to make this website so other people may follow it as a guide to learn as well. I will add also books that I plan to read in the future, or books that I am curious about. I hope you enjoy my site!  feel free to leave me a message at <a href="mailto:jonspurling1@gmail.com">jonspurling1@gmail.com </a> if you have any book suggestions for me.</p>
